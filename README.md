This project is an investigation of interrelation of CO2 emission (kt) of 12 different countries chosen from different continents from 1990 to 2015 and other factors such as electric power consumption, overall energy use, GDP in US ($),  urban population percentage, electricity access percentage and renewable energy usage.

Climate-change world bank data is in the climage-change.csv file as it is. All the factors except GDP are extracted from original climage-change csv file which is in this repository.

GDP of the countries is extracted from economy-and-growth world bank data. Original csv file is more than 25 MB. Thus, this file cannot be uploaded. <b> Please download the economy-and-growth data from https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/topic/3?downloadformat=csv 

<b> Then unzip the files and rename the original csv file to "economy-and-growth.csv" prior to running the program.
